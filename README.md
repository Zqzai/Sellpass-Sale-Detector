# Sellpass Sale Detector
Own a Sellpass store and would like to automatically run functions/deliver within a second of a purchase completion? Well here's what you need!

# How do I set this up?
To set this up, simply run "Sellix API.py" and the instructions will be shown to you. Keep in mind that you can always change your settings after they are saved by deleting the config.json file and reload the program.
